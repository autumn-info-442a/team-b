# Architecture

- Models:
  - Location
    - This component is a model that stores all the Covid related data associated with a specific location such as Covid Cases in the past day, past week, total deaths, etc found from the NovelCovid API
    - Model resides only on the client
    - The county model will be used on the CountyDetail view as well as the HomePage view and CountyCard view to display Covid information associated with the county as well as the USDashboard view
    - Code Snippet:
    ```
    class Location extends Component {
      //TO-DO: Implement actual component
      constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = {
          cases = 10323;
          deaths = 1312;
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  - UserStorage
    - This component is a model that stores all of the users information like saved location, current location, and unique user url.

    - Code Snippet:
    ```
    class UserStorage extends Component {
      //TO-DO: Implement actual component
      constructor(props) {
